##New TrackAbout Release Schedule

As of November 2016, TrackAbout has changed the process for releasing software updates. TrackAbout will be moving to mid-month release end dates for our development. TrackAbout believes this change will benefit both our development team and our clients.

###New Release Schedule
 - **Test Environments** - For our clients using test environments, software releases will take place 7 business days after our development end date, which is the 15th of each month. Therefore, test environments will be updated on or around the 25th of each month.
 - **Production Environments** - Software releases will take place 10 business days after the release to our test environment, which is on or around the 10th of the next month.
 
Should you have any questions or concerns about this new process please feel free to contact TrackAbout Support at [support@trackabout.com](mailto:support@trackabout.com) or 412-269-1872 ext 8.
