##Hosting Migration February 3 Weekend
Hosting migration to Microsoft Azure **will take place** this coming weekend beginning the evening of Friday, Feb 3 and continuing through the weekend.

For full details, [please read this document](https://meta.trackabout.com/wiki/Azure_Migration_Announcement).

##Changes to Mobile Device Authorization for TAMobile 6 Clients
For our clients that are currently using TAMobile 6 on handheld devices and mobile unit passwords, TrackAbout is enhancing the way we authenticate users. 

###What does this mean?

When users log in, their access and permissions will be authenticated with the site, to ensure that the user is valid.  TrackAbout will also verify that a user has permissions to save action records upon a wireless save. 

For example, if Joe Smith saves a Fill record, when the record is saved wirelessly, TrackAbout will verify that Joe is indeed a Filler with the appropriate rights to use the Fill action.

###Session Length

Once a user in logged into TrackAbout on a handheld, they have **30 idle minutes** before TrackAbout will ask them to enter their PIN again.  **This session time only applies to online/wireless save actions**.  Each time a user saves an action or the system does a lookup to the TrackAbout server the session length will start again.  

###What if I only use actions offline, like Delivery?

This will not affect you, as the records will be saved locally on the device.  This process only affects **online save actions**.

###How do I know if I use PINs?

When you log into the TrackAbout application on your device, and you are asked to **"Enter your PIN"**, your authentication process will change as stated above.

Should you have any questions or concerns about this new process please feel free to contact TrackAbout Support at [support@trackabout.com](mailto:support@trackabout.com) or 412-269-1872 ext 8.
