##Security Enhancement - Change to Mobile Device Login for TAMobile 6 Clients
This change applies to clients using PIN-based login with TAMobile 6 on rugged handhelds.

###What does this mean?

If you are connected to the internet when you login, the handheld will talk to TrackAbout's website to verify your information. After that, you'll be able to use the handheld as you do today. 

If you're not online when you login, you'll still be able to use the handheld like you do today. Once you come back online and do anything that needs to talk to TrackAbout's website (like save a record), you'll need to enter your PIN so we can verify you. 

###Session Duration

Once a user is logged into TrackAbout on a handheld, they have **30 minutes** before TrackAbout will ask them to enter their PIN again. **This session time only applies to online/wireless save actions**. Each time a user saves an action or the handheld talks to the TrackAbout server, the 30 minute session is reset.

###What if I only use actions offline, like Delivery?

This will not affect you, as the records will be saved locally on the device. This process only affects **online save actions**. You'll only be promted for your PIN when you sync your records to the server at the end of the day.

###How do I know if I use PINs?

If you log into the TrackAbout application on your device, and you are asked to **"Enter your PIN"**, your authentication process will change as stated above.

Should you have any questions or concerns about this new process please feel free to contact TrackAbout Support at [support@trackabout.com](mailto:support@trackabout.com) or 412-269-1872 ext 8.
